# 🏦 Evaluating Stablecoins: Risks & Recommendations

## 🚨 Risks to Consider
1. **Loss of Reserves**: Example: USDC had funds in Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed. A stablecoin’s safety hinges on its reserves.
   
2. **CBDCs**: Central Bank Digital Currencies might eventually replace stablecoins, but this is not an immediate concern.

3. **USD Devaluation**: Stablecoins are pegged to USD, so if USD devalues, stablecoins may too. Keep an eye on USD stability.

## 📊 Top 5 Stablecoins

### 2. **USD Coin (USDC)**
